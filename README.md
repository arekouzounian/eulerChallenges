# eulerChallenges
This repository is a collection of the code I used to solve the different challenges on projecteuler.net.

I don't have much in here; I mostly do these challenges for fun and in my free time. Also, the answers here often may not be the most efficient or sometimes even correct, but this github is just to be able to access what problem's I've solved, and how I could possibly improve them in the future.
